 * {@code

 *     try {
 *         obj = pool.borrowObject(key, timeout);
 *         try {

 *             // invalidate the object
 *             try {
 *                 pool.removeObject(key, obj);
 *             } catch(Exception ignore) {
 *             }
 *             // do not return the object to the pool twice
 *             obj = null;
 *         } finally {
 *             // make sure the object is returned to the pool
 *             if(obj != null) {
 *                 try {
 *                     pool.returnObject(key, obj);
 *                 } catch(Exception ignore) {
 *                 }
 *             }
 *         }
 *     } catch(Exception e) {
